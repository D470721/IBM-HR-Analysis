### Project Overview
This project involves the analysis of IBMâ€™s HR dataset to uncover trends and patterns in employee demographics, job roles, and compensation. The goal is to provide insights into workforce distribution across different categories such as age, gender, job roles, education field, department, marital status, and business travel frequency.

### Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
1.	To analyze workforce demographics by evaluating age, gender, education, and marital status distributions.
2.	To identify key trends in job roles and departmental distribution to understand workforce composition.
3.	To assess business travel frequency and its potential impact on employee roles and job satisfaction.
4.	To provide insights into salary distribution across different job roles and departments.
5.	To recommend actionable strategies for workforce planning and employee retention.

### Methodology
The dataset contains multiple fields, including age, gender, job role, department, education field, and business travel frequency. Key columns analyzed include:
-	Age: Represents the age distribution of employees.
-	Gender: Indicates the proportion of male and female employees.
-	Hourly Rate: Displays the spread of employee hourly wages.
-	Job Role: Categorizes employees based on their job titles.
-	Education Field: Shows the background education of employees.
-	Department: Groups employees into different functional areas.
-	Marital Status: Differentiates employees based on their relationship status.

### Tools and Techniques Used
-	Power BI for visualization
-	Data filtering and categorization
-	Bar charts, pie charts, and histograms for data representation

### Types of Analysis
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to explore and visualize key trends within the dataset. This included:
-	Descriptive Statistics: Summary statistics were used to understand the central tendencies and spread of numerical variables.
-	Distribution Analysis: Histograms and bar charts helped in understanding the distribution of age, hourly rate, and department-wise employee count.
-	Comparative Analysis: Pie charts and bar graphs were utilized to compare gender distribution, marital status proportions, and education backgrounds.
-	Categorical Analysis: Employee job roles, business travel frequency, and department-wise representation were examined using categorical data visualizations.-
- Trend Analysis: Patterns such as peak age groups, most common job roles, and dominant education fields were identified to provide a clearer picture of employee demographics.

### Key Performance Indicators
-	What is the age distribution of employees?
-	What is the gender ratio among employees?
-	How are employees distributed across different job roles and departments?
-	What is the impact of business travel on employees?
-	What are the most common education backgrounds of employees?

### Data Analysis and Results
-	The majority of employees are between the ages of 30 and 40.

- Research & Development is the largest department, followed by Sales and Human Resources.
-	Sales Executives and Research Scientists are the most common job roles.
-	Life Sciences and Medical fields dominate the educational background of employees.
-	A significant proportion of employees rarely travel for work.

### Key Insights
